standard-reporter
=================

Allows you to pipe uber/standard or feross/standard output and get different
reporting formats.

Usage
-----

```
$ standard | standard-reporter
$ standard | standard-reporter --stylish
$ standard | standard-reporter --json > lint.json
$ standard | standard-reporter --checkstyle > lint.xml
```

If you put standard in verbose mode, the results will also include the lint rule
name. If you're using an older version of standard that doesn't print lint
errors on stdout, you will need to redirect stderr output to stdout.
